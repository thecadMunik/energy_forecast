        "## 1. **meter_id**\n",
        "- Metrics Range is between 1000 - 1100, Mean is 1052, Median is 1052 and Mode is 1083. All meter_ids have roughly equal counts, no dominant meter.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **What this means:**\n",
        "The dataset covers a well-balanced spread of meter_ids, which reduces the risk of bias from overrepresented meters. This uniformity supports generalizability of any model or insight across all monitored units. In real-world terms, it suggests that each household or site is sampled at similar frequency, preventing location-based skew in energy analytics.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. **power_consumption_kwh**\n",
        "- Metrics Range is between 0.1 - 5 kWh per 30 minutes, Mean is approxiamately 1.35 kWh, Median is ~0.67 kWh, and Mode is ~0.13 kWh. ~60% of readings are below 1 kWh; the distribution is strongly right-skewed.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **What this means:**\n",
        "Most intervals have low consumption, but there are occasional intervals or users with much higher usage, which drive up the mean. Most of the time, usage is low or moderate, but there are spikes, possibly due to specific high-demand activities (e.g., EV charging, industrial equipment, HVAC use).\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. **voltage**\n",
        "- Metrics are Range: 224 V - 231 V, Mean: ~228.6 V, Median: ~229 V, Mode: 229 V\n",
        "~90% of all readings fall between 227 V and 231 V.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **What this means:**\n",
        "The voltage distribution is tight and nearly normal, with most readings very close to the nominal supply voltage. This indicates a stable and reliable grid supply. Occasional lower values could reflect brief voltage dips or simulation artifacts, but overall there is little risk of power quality issues affecting energy consumption analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. **current**\n",
        "- Metrics Range: 0.35 - 22.2 A, Mean: ~5.94 A, Median: ~2.92 A, Mode: ~1.08 A.\n",
        "Over 70% of readings are below 5 A; distribution is right-skewed.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **What this means:**\n",
        "Most of the time, the measured current is low, but there are infrequent but substantial spikes. These spikes likely correspond to the use of high-power appliances or charging devices. This distribution is common in household and commercial environments, where baseline consumption is low but punctuated by occasional heavy draws.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. **temperature_c**\n",
        "- Metrics are: Range: 6.6°C - 32.2°C, Mean: ~19.4°C, Median: ~19.7°C, Mode: 10.5°C.\n",
        "~80% of readings are between 10°C and 28°C, with mild bimodality.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **What this means:**\n",
        "The temperature readings cover a broad but realistic range, possibly reflecting data from different times of day or simulated regions. The slight bimodal shape may indicate two climatic patterns or artificial variation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. **humidity_pct**\n",
        "- Metrics Range: 52.3% - 87.7%, Mean: ~69.9%, Median: ~69.8%, Mode: 82.1%.\n",
        "~85% of readings are between 55% and 85%; broad and slightly multi-modal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **What this means:**\n",
        "The wide range and fairly even spread of humidity values suggest the data includes both humid and relatively dry intervals. This variation can be useful for correlating with cooling or heating demand, though the lack of strong peaks implies that humidity alone is unlikely to drive major changes in energy usage in this sample. The presence of multiple small peaks may reflect different regions or microclimates within your dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 7. **hour_of_day**\n",
        "- Metrics Range: 0 - 23, Mean: ~11.5. Each hour is almost equally represented with ~28 readings per hour.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **What this means:**\n",
        "The dataset is very well-balanced across the 24-hour cycle, ensuring robust coverage of daily consumption patterns. This allows for reliable analysis of hourly and diurnal trends, with no bias toward particular times of day.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 8. **week**\n",
        "- Metrics: Observed weeks: 27, 28, 29.\n",
        "Most data comes from week 28, followed by week 29 and then week 27.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **What this means:**\n",
        "Data collection spans three distinct weeks, but the sample size varies between weeks. Most observations fall in week 28, which could skew weekly analysis unless balanced with resampling or weighted metrics. The presence of multiple weeks supports investigation into week-to-week variation."
